<h1 id="codeup">Bold rocky: A Short Story by doggy</h1>
<div class="codeup">
<p class="paragraph">rocky had always loved clean Hong Kong with its soft, sneezing stones. It was a place where he felt eccentric. He was a bold, loyal, coffee drinker with big feet and giant eyes. His friends saw him as a courageous, chilly cleopatra. Once, he had even rescued an ill puppy from a burning building. That's the sort of man he was. rocky walked over to the window and reflected on his safe surroundings. The snow flurried like swimming dog.
  Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of sasha . sasha was a creative Chuck Norris with huge feet and extra-large eyes. rocky gulped. He was not prepared for sasha.</p>
